  "Dear @player,^^If you're reading this, you must be in dire need of a change.^^The same thing happened to me, long ago. I'd lost sight of what mattered most in life... real connections with other people and nature. So I dropped everything and moved to the place I truly belong.^^^I've enclosed the deed to that place... my pride and joy: @farm Farm. It's located in Stardew Valley, on the southern coast. It's the perfect place to start your new life.^^This was my most precious gift of all, and now it's yours. I know you'll honor the family name, my boy. Good luck.^^Love, Grandpa^^P.S. If Lewis is still alive say hi to the old guy for me, will ya?": "",
