  "I beat all these games last year!": "",
  "I learned all of Robin's techniques last year, but she's always one step ahead of me!": "",
  "mumph... This is my one chance to pig out on barbecue sandwiches.": "",
  "I hope we win the grange display contest!": "",
  "Did you remember to bring good stuff for our grange display? I hope we win this year.": "",
  "Hey, @player. I'm just catching up with Sam. Go ahead and have some fun.": "",
  "Sebastian's the same as always. Are you having fun at the festival?": "",
  "I'm just catching up with some old friends... you go on and have a good time.": "",
  "I'll wait here until you're ready to go home...": "",
  "The smokey aroma drew me here, yet 'twas the zesty sauce that truly sealed my fate... *gurgle*": "",
  "I already beat all the games... now what?": "",
  "Woodworking is an ancient tradition that I'm very proud to be a part of.": "",
  "Robin really works hard on her carpentry stuff... she deserves a little recognition now and then.": "",
  "*slurp* mmm... this barbecue sauce is amazing.": "",
  "It's kinda hectic today... I'm just gonna hang out here for a while.": "",
  "My store carries the very finest quality products in the whole valley. Please, inspect my grange display closely and see for yourself!": "",
  "Pierre is very serious about his grange display. He's been setting aside the best-looking produce for weeks in preparation.": "",
  "Hey, best of luck to you if you enter!": "",
  "These animals never judge people by their looks. The same can't be said for humans.": "",

  "Hmm... smoked turkey haunch? I guess this festival isn't all bad.": "",
  "I wish Gus would include a vegetarian option. Some zucchinni skewers, maybe?": "",
  "Well @player, It's the big day... Our most important festival of the year, the 'Stardew Valley Fair'.": "",
  "If you'd like to participate by setting up a grange display, I've left an empty stand for you. Just let me know after you've set everything up so we can get to the judging.": "",
  "I complain about my job sometimes, but I do take pride in my work.": "",
  "These are some of my finest pieces. I hope you like them.": "",
  "You know, I would've made a pretty good clown. I think I missed my calling.": "",
  "I won the wheel of chance ten times in a row and now the man won't let me play anymore...": "",
  "Better hurry up, kid... Before ol' Pam here fishes every last lunker out of the tent! Hehe.": "",
  "Have you been to the fortune teller? She set up her stand in the graveyard.": "",
  "I already saw her... she told me something... interesting. *giggle*": "",
  "He doesn't look very happy... I guess Mayor Lewis had to cut costs with a budget clown this year.": "",
  "I'm waiting for this clown to start doing something funny.": "",
  "Pretty disappointing.": "",
  "Hey @player. Having a good time?": "",
  "The slingshot tent is pretty fun, and if you get good at it you can really rack up the star tokens.": "",
  "I really admire Robin's carpentry skills. I use a lot of the same techniques in my own line of work.": "",
  "All these animals are friendly and love to get massaged.": "",
  "I tried my best, but my display is pretty weak compared to Pierre's.": "",
  "Well, maybe the judges will give me bonus points for the massive cheese wheel.": "",
  "I'm trying to get Gus to tell me his sauce recipe, but he won't budge.": "",
  "Eat as much as you like! It's all free today... compliments of Mayor Lewis.": "",
  "Oh! Make sure to dribble some of my secret sauce on there.": "",
  "You say it's raining up above? *gasp*": "",

  "Was it the school of illusion? Or maybe the Carnival of Secrets? Hmm...": "",
  "And just a few steps over there, Gus is grilling up a batch of pork ribs... Yikes.": "",

  "Oh... These vapors... Hmmm... You look nice tonight.": "",

  "I'm lost...": "",
  "I have no idea how these skeletons are walking... creepy.": "",
  "It's pretty cool though.": "",
  "??": "",
  "I get scared very easily. I'll leave the haunted maze to the younger people.": "",
  "Good show, old friend.": "",
  "There's something weird over there. But how do I get to it?": "",
  "There's gotta be a secret passage somewhere around here.": "",
  "Hmm... smoked turkey haunch? I guess this festival isn't all bad.": "",
  "I wish Gus would include a vegetarian option. Some zucchinni skewers, maybe?": "",
  "Good evening, @player. Have you ventured into the haunted maze yet? It's quite spooky.": "",
  "That strange man who lives in the tower set it all up himself. He wouldn't let anyone near while he was working on it.": "",
  "One of my iridium-infused maces would make quick work of these things.": "",
  "Do you like the jack-o-lanterns? I carved them myself.": "",
  "The vapor from this cauldron... it's making my head spin, but I can't seem to leave...": "",
  "I'll come to any event with free grub! You won't see me in the haunted maze, though.": "",
  "Eek! I'm too scared.": "",
  "Vincent's upset that I won't let him go into the haunted maze... but he's just a little boy!": "",
  "Hey, @player. Nice evening, isn't it?": "",
  "That's odd... It's just a dead end up ahead.": "",
  "I could've sworn there was someone ahead of me when I went through the maze, though. Where'd they go?": "",
  "Mm, hi. Sorry... mouth full of blackberries.": "",
  "Hi, @player. Have you had a productive fall?": "",
  "It's starting to get quite cold... crops won't hold out for much longer.": "",
  "Why, hello @player. It's chilly, isn't it?": "",
  "It's a lot of fun to cook with pumpkin. Such an interesting fruit.": "",
  "You say it's raining up above? *gasp*": "",
  "Rain... It's almost mythical to us. Some of us live our entire lives without ever experiencing it.": "",
  "The affairs of mundane folk matter little to me, but the elementals like a chance to see you up close.": "",
  "It was for them that I created this silly maze.": "",
  "Oh! You found me...": "",
  "The truth is, I got too scared so I came here to hide. Don't tell anyone.": "",
  "Why is there no more pumpkin ale?": "",
  "I heard it's raining back home. Is that why you came here?": "",
  "I kind of miss the rain, actually...": "",
  "But Aunt Marnie! I wanna go in the maze! I'm not scared!": "",

  "Let the egg hunt begin!": "",
  "Go away, we're adversaries until the egg hunt is over!": "",
  "I never had many friends in town, so these events are always kind of boring for me. I enjoy the buffet, though.": "",

  "Maru's trying to convince me to eat a deviled egg. I'm just not sure I can stomach it...": "",

  "The gang's just the same as always. Are you having a good time?": "",
  "Ungh... I think I ate a dozen too many hard boiled eggs...": "",
  "How is everyone doing? I'm just taking a break for a little while. I'm looking forward to seeing you in the egg hunt!": "",
  "I enjoy seeing you so relaxed, my dear.": "",
  "Searching for eggs is like going on a treasure hunt.": "",
  "Spring is a busy time of year... so it's nice to have a day off to catch up with friends.": "",
  "Egg... what a strange thing to eat.": "",
  "I always look forward to these gatherings... it makes the valley feel like a real community.": "",
  "We used to do a rotten egg toss...": "",
  "Mayor Lewis put an end to that pretty quick.": "",
  "No one really talks to me... I just come for the deviled eggs.": "",

  "The children have been looking forward to this festival for weeks.": "",
  "Hehe... I put something nice into the punch.": "",
  "Shhh... that's just between you and me, kid.": "",
  "I've been up since dawn coloring eggs... it's always my favorite part of the season.": "",
  "This festival is alright... but what I'm really looking foward to is the Flower Dance.": "",
  "Vincent loves this festival... it's a joy to see him so happy.": "",

  "Even with my bad leg, I never miss a town festival.": "",

  "Of course! I've been looking forward to this all year.": "",
  "...": "",
  "Hmmm... Well it's not bad, but it's missing something...": "",
  "Did everyone in town contribute an ingredient to the soup? I feel like it's missing someone's unique voice.": "",
  "You're right... It's a little bland.": "",
  "Well, thanks for joining us this year, Governor. Sorry the soup wasn't anything special.": "",
  "Now... who else wants some soup?": "",
  "The soup was bland, but the luau was still fun!": "",
  "Time to head home.": "",
  "Oh my... that's the best soup I've ever tasted!": "",
  "You're right... It's delicious!": "",
  "Wonderful job, everyone! Now... who else wants a taste?": "",
  "The Governor wasn't kidding... the soup was out of this world!": "",

  "Now... who else wants some soup?": "",
  "The Luau was a success! Good thing I brought something tasty for the soup.": "",

  "Hmm... I don't have much to say about this. It's an average soup.": "",
  "He's right... It's nothing special. Not bad, though.": "",
  "Well... who else wants some soup?": "",
  "The soup was just average, but otherwise the Luau was a success!": "",
  "Time to head home.": "",
  "Um... It's actually kind of disgusting. I think I'll pass on the soup this year.": "",
  "Yuck. Someone must have ruined it with a poor-quality ingredient.": "",
  "Well... does anyone want any?": "",

  "I'm doing my best to stay in a good mood...": "",

  "Hey, I'll take any excuse to come hang out at the beach. This weather is amazing!": "",
  "Oh dear... I've got sand in my socks...": "",

  "Ow... you stepped on my foot, dear.": "",
  "This is tiring, honey. Are you ready to visit the buffet soon? *pant*": "",
  "Whatever Linus is roasting smells awfully good... *slurp*": "",
  "One year Sam put a pound of anchovies in the potluck soup.": "",

  "A slow, continuous rotation is key to achieving the perfect roast.": "",
  "Hmm... maybe if I get on the governor's good side he'll give my business a tax break...": "",

  "If you brought something for the potluck make sure and add it to the soup cauldron.": "",
  "I'm full, but what else is there to do besides eat?": "",
  "We do this festival every year to give the governor a taste of everything the valley has to offer.": "",
  "Mayor Lewis hopes it will get the governor on our good side. That's why he's so neurotic about the way the soup tastes.": "",
  "Heh... free buffet. One of the perks of living here. Enjoy it, kid!": "",
  "I would dance, but I don't want to get sweaty.": "",
  "I hope the soup is good this year.": "",

  "Why should I care about some random old guy?": "",
  "How's the farming coming along? It must be a busy season for you.": "",
  "Wow... you don't get hot pepper chutney like this in the big city...": "",
  "If you brought something for the soup, climb the stairs on the other side and throw it in.": "",

  "An Igloo makes a nice home, but it's easier to just stay in my tent year-round.": "",
  "Snowmen are okay, I guess. But mostly I'm looking forward to the spring.": "",
  "Hmmph... Wife dragged me out into the cold for this?": "",
  "Did I ever tell you how George and I first met? He actually pelted me with a snowball in this very festival.": "",
  "He was a gentleman back then, and came over to see if I was okay.": "",
  "Welcome to the Festival of Ice!": "",
  "The highlight of today's festival is the ice fishing competition. We set up this 'frozen lake' and stocked it full of fish.": "",
  "Just let me know when you're ready to compete.": "",
  "Emily started helping me without any provocation... does that mean something? *gulp*": "",
  "Wow, this snowman needs a makeover. Who made this?": "",
  "I plan on winning the ice fishing competition!": "",
  "Willy is gonna be pretty hard to beat, though... He does this kinda stuff day and night.": "",
  "I guess Winter isn't all bad... playing in the snow can be fun!": "",
  "The forest looks beautiful in the winter, doesn't it?": "",
  "I like winter. It's peaceful.": "",
  "Hey, @player. Are you gonna enter the ice fishing competition?": "",
  "Oh, not me. I don't know how to fish.": "",
  "Oh, ice. A beautiful material to sculpt in, but so impermanent.": "",
  "But I guess that might make the art even better.": "",
  "I feel bad for all the poor, cold animals out there.": "",
  "I'm entering the ice fishing competition today. Why not?": "",
  "It's rare that Willy ever loses, though.": "",
  "Sorry there's no food.": "",
  "Just wait until the Feast of the Winter Star. You'll be stuffed for days.": "",
  "Sneaking off to visit my weird tower? You're odd for a mundane.": "",
  "Extreme temperatures can put your body under a lot of stress, so make sure to bundle up!": "",
  "Oh, and enjoy the festival!": "",
  "I heard it's raining back home. Is that why you came here?": "",
  "I kind of miss the rain, actually...": "",
  "I wanna give him a carrot nose!": "",
  "I saw a big fish down there!": "",

  "I wonder if I could lick one of those canes...": "",
  "I'm thankful for our simple life on the farm.": "",
  "Hey, @player. I'm ready to head home whenever you are.": "",
  "I'm thankful to have met you...": "",
  "Me?... Oh, I'm thankful for... how about I just show you when we get home tonight?": "",
  "Hey, @player. As you can see, I'm fulfilling my family obligations...": "",
  "*yawn*... I'm here for the gifts and the cookies.": "",
  "What am I thankful for? I'll show you when we get back home...": "",
  "I'm feeling a little overwhelmed... thank goodness for this crisp air...": "",
  "You don't need to get me anything, you've already given me the greatest gift of all...": "",
  "Nothing like a piping hot feast on a cold winter's day, huh?": "",
  "Hiya, @player. You're welcome to join our family table if you need company.": "",
  "I'll probably get another tool set this year... *sigh*": "",
  "Hi, @player.": "",
  "I've met some people who believe in spirits, and magic... but me? I've never seen anything that couldn't be explained by science.": "",
  "Spending time with family is tiring sometimes.": "",
  "My sales figures have been phenomenal lately... thanks to the Feast of the Winter Star!": "",
  "Boy, holidays are good for business. I wonder if I could invent some new ones...": "",
  "Ooohh... I've had too much nog.": "",
  "I'd join in... but I don't think I'm welcome.": "",
  "Oh, hello.": "",
  "A feast for some stupid star? Humbug!": "",

  "What a beautiful tree.": "",

  "Gus was just telling me about his artisan candy canes. *yawn*": "",
  "I think he had too much cinnamon nog.": "",
  "Welcome to the Feast of the Winter Star!": "",
  "Why, hello @player. It's chilly, isn't it?": "",
  "It's a fine art, making candy canes. You've really got to search far and wide for the best ingredients. They aren't easy to come by these days!": "",
  "I usually use Fern Island Ringfruit for my premier canes, you know. You can't beat that bright red coloring... And it's all natural!": "",
  "Oh, you want to know the secret to my deluxe double-canes? Okay, but you've got to promise absolute secrecy. *whisper* It's a drop of vanilla in the white candy": "",
  "to complement the cherry flavor.": "",
  "Of course, peppermint candy canes are the standard, and I always make a healthy batch of those as well.": "",
  "Hey, you look like you're falling asleep. Are you okay?": "",
  "Ah, the mysterious Winter Star. One of the reasons I chose this valley as the location for my... research.": "",
  "I'm thankful there were no medical emergencies this year!": "",
