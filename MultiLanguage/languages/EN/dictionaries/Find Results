It is rumored that he lives in a log submerged in the mountain lake, and only ventures out on rainy spring days to nibble at the frog's eggs.

  448:   "I brought the children on a little field trip into the countryside.": "",

  476:   "Um, Farmer @player? If I eat your veggies will I grow up strong like my big brother Sam?": "",

  478:   "Vincent! It's not good to gossip!": "",
  479:   "Yes, Vincent?": "",
  480:   "Farmer @player? Can I put a saddle on one of your cows and ride it into town? I wanna be a real cowboy!": "",

  482:   "Vincent! Behave yourself. Ms. @player makes her living working on the farm! It's not a playground.": "",
  483:   "Yes, Vincent?": "",
  484:   "Farmer @player? Is it true that goblins live deep in the caves... and that they like to kidnap little girls for their dinner?": "",
  485:   "Vincent! You're scaring Jas. Let's not talk about monsters.": "",

  487:   "It's a lot of work to take care of these kids...": "",

 1251:   "The skeleton is too quick, and strikes out at your party before anyone has a chance to attack!": "",
 1252:   "The force of the blow sends your party flying backwards. Unable to stop in time, you tumble down a steep slope and splash into something wet.": "",
 1253:   "You turn and run along a dim corridor. The cold stone slopes and spirals downward for what seems like an eternity. Finally, you emerge into a new area.": "",

 1288:   "Xarth is defeated, and the Solarion Staff glows peacefully. Order has been restored to the world.": "",
 1289:   "Before you have a chance to cast your spell, Xarth sends a shadow beam at your companions!": "",

 1585:   "You're right, sir. Sam should respect private property.": "",
 1586:   "Don't blame Sam. There's nowhere else for him to ride!": "",
 1587:   "I'm staying out of this.": "",
 1588:   "Fine! I just won't ride my skateboard ever again. Happy?": "",
 1589:   "Exactly! If there was a park in town, I could ride there and everyone would be happy.": "",
 1590:   "Hmmph. Alright.": "",
 1591:   "You're being difficult, Sam. I have no problem with you riding around town, just try not to cause any damage! It's that simple.": "",
 1592:   "Hmmph. I thought you were more mature than this, @player.": "",
 1593:   "I'll let it slide this time, Sam. But I don't want to see you doing this anymore.": "",
 1594:   "Got it?": "",
 1595:   "Sam... I'm sorry I yelled at you. Just please try not to damage anything in the future. Got it?": "",
 1596:   "Got it?": "",
 1597:   "Yes, sir.": "",
 1598:   "...Did you see that trick, though? That was rad.": "",
 1599:   "@player! You're here!": "",
 1600:   "Okay... I guess I'd better introduce my pieces. Wish me luck!": "",
 1601:   "Umm... Okay everyone!": "",
 1602:   "Thanks for coming to my art show.": "",
 1603:   "As some of you know, I came to this town because I wanted to draw inspiration from the beautiful surroundings.": "",
 1604:   "This place really feels like home now.": "",
 1605:   "Okay. I'm going to introduce my sculptures now.": "",
 1606:   "I haven't named this one, yet. She started out as an exercise in human anatomy, but I ended up seeing her through to completion.": "",
 1607:   "Her expression is intentionally unclear... is she embarrassed, amused, pained? I'll leave that for you to decide.": "",
 1608:   "This one's called 'Post-Dimensional Nullspace'. It represents the boundary of human imagination.": "",
 1609:   "The shape and color came to me vividly when I was in a 'trance state'.": "",
 1610:   "I've been calling this one 'Egg Heads'. I wanted to create an animatronic humanoid statue to toy with the viewer's ability to properly attribute personhood to a physical entity.": "",
 1611:   "And the last one is called 'Wood Sculpture 3'. It's a celebration of my favorite sculpting material... wood.": "",
 1612:   "Well, those are my sculptures!": "",
 1613:   "Oh! One last thing.": "",
 1614:   "I'd like to say thanks to my special friend, @player.": "",
 1615:   "He gave me the idea for this show and the courage to go through with it. I know that sounds cheesy, but it's true.": "",
 1616:   "She gave me the idea for this show and the courage to go through with it. I know that sounds cheesy, but it's true.": "",
 1617:   "I'm proud of you, Leah! Events like this really breathe life into our little town!": "",
 1618:   "Great stuff!": "",
 1619:   "I love your art, Leah! 'Post-Dimensional Nullspace' is my favorite.": "",
 1620:   "Great use of wood!": "",
 1621:   "Thanks for doing this!": "",
 1622:   "Thanks, everyone!": "",
 1623:   "Now let's start the bidding on these wonderful art pieces... A marvelous addition to your home!": "",
 1624:   "Do I hear 5000g for the pink one?": "",
 1625:   "Wow! I'm exhausted.": "",
 1626:   "My show was a real success, wasn't it?": "",
 1627:   "Marnie... we can't. If word got out, it could undermine my position of authority in the town!": "",
 1628:   "You understand... don't you?": "",
 1629:   "You care too much about your job, Lewis. There are other things to life, you know.": "",
 1630:   "...but yes, I understand. I guess we'll have to keep...us...a secret.": "",
 1631:   "Gahh!": "",
 1632:   "@player...You overheard everything, didn't you?": "",
 1633:   "Yes... but I'll keep it a secret.": "",
 1634:   "Yes... and I'm going to tell everyone.": "",
 1635:   "Why were you hiding there, anyway?": "",
 1636:   "@player!": "",
 1637:   "...You caught me.": "",
 1638:   "I was planning to ask Emily on a date. I was at her doorstep and everything... but then I heard her coming and I dove into this bush.": "",
 1639:   "Now I'm waiting until she's done talking with Caroline so I can sneak back into my house.": "",
 1640:   "What did you just say? You'll never upgrade your tools again if I don't ask her out?": "",
 1641:   "You're a villain, @player.": "",
 1642:   "*sigh* ...alright, I'll do it.": "",
 1643:   "I gotta remember that advice @player gave me in the saloon.": "",
 1644:   "Um... Emily?": "",
 1645:   "Sorry, Caroline. Could you excuse me for a minute?": "",
 1646:   "Yes, Clint?": "",
 1647:   "I was wondering if you'd go w... with... tomorrow, me... *gulp*": "",
 1648:   "I've got two tickets for the Grampleton Carnival tomorrow. W... Would you go with me? ": "",
 1649:   "Sure, Clint! That sounds fun!": "",
 1650:   "Really? Okay! I'll pick you up at five.": "",
 1651:   "Okay! See you tomorrow!": "",
 1652:   "Did you see that?! I've got a date tomorrow night!": "",
 1653:   "Oh man...I'm so nervous.": "",
 1654:   "Thanks for forcing me to do that, earlier. I'm scared, but also very pleased.": "",
 1655:   "Hi @player.": "",
 1656:   "I wanted to talk to you in private...": "",
 1657:   "It's kinda cold out here though... let's sneak into my room.": "",
 1658:   "So... @player.": "",
 1659:   "I know I've been talking about nothing but the band for a while now... But I don't want you to think that's all I'm interested in.": "",
 1660:   "Um... Er... What I mean is...": "",
 1661:   "Well, I'm really happy that we've grown so close... Heh.": "",
 1662:   "@player... do you think of me as... just a friend?": "",
 1663:   "Sam? I'm coming in!": "",
 1664:   "Quick! Hide in the bed!": "",
 1665:   "What's wrong, Honey? Were you doing something... bad?": "",
 1666:   "I thought I heard some weird sounds coming from your room...": "",
 1667:   "No Mom! I was just... doing push-ups! I wanna beat Dad at arm-wrestling some day! ...heh.": "",
 1668:   "Oh! *giggle*... That explains why you're all red and sweaty.": "",
 1669:   "Okay, well good luck. I'll see you in the morning.": "",
 1670:   "Goodnight, Mom.": "",
 1671:   "Whew... That was close.": "",
 1672:   "...@player?": "",
 1673:   "Get out of the bed.": "",
 1674:   "Stay put.": "",
 1675:   "Earlier, I was trying to say... that I really like you, @player. I think we could really have something special together... Know what I mean?": "",
 1676:   "Alright, I said it.": "",
 1677:   "Move closer to Sam.": "",
 1678:   "Head for the window.": "",
 1679:   "I'm going to be thinking about this night for a long time...": "",
 1680:   "...": "",
 1681:   "Oh, hi there.": "",
 1682:   "What an eyesore...": "",
 1683:   "This is the Pelican Town Community Center... or what's left of it, anyway.": "",
 1684:   "It used to be the pride and joy of the town... always bustling with activity.": "",
 1685:   "Now... just look at it. It's shameful.": "",
 1686:   "These days, the young folk would rather sit in front of the TV than engage with the community.": "",
 1687:   "But listen to me, I sound like an old fool.": "",
 1688:   "Joja Corporation has been hounding me to sell them the land so they can turn it into a warehouse...": "",
 1689:   "Pelican Town could use the money, but there's something stopping me from selling it... I guess old timers like me get attached to relics of the past... Ah well.": "",
 1690:   "If anyone else buys a Joja Co. Membership I'm just gonna go ahead and sell it.": "",
 1691:   "*sigh*... Here, let's go inside...": "",
 1692:   "Hmm? What's this?...": "",
 1693:   "I guess Vincent and Jas must've been playing in here.": "",
 1694:   "This place is even more dilapidated than I remember.": "",
 1695:   "What?": "",
 1696:   "What's the matter? Are you ill?": "",
 1697:   "You saw something? Hmm... I wouldn't be surprised if this place was full of rats.": "",
 1698:   "You're worrying me, @player...": "",
 1699:   "Look, I think I'm going to head home. I need some lunch.": "",
 1700:   "Hey. I'll keep this place unlocked from now on... maybe you can help catch that rat if you have some extra time.": "",
 1701:   "Strange...": "",
 1702:   "I'll have to come back and explore this building further.": "",
 1703:   "I'm not sure how you did it, @player... but the community center has never looked better!": "",
 1704:   "You've done Pelican Town a great service. Everyone in town is pleased.": "",
 1705:   "As a way of saying 'Thank You', I'd like to present you with this Town's greatest honor... The Stardew Hero Award. You've earned it!": "",
 1706:   "VOICE: Grumble... Grumble...": "",
 1707:   "Who's that?": "",
 1708:   "Sales have been plummeting! Where have all my customers gone?": "",
 1709:   "Ah, Morris.": "",
 1710:   "Waa..?!": "",
 1711:   "All my customers...Here?!?": "",
 1712:   "This isn't good...": "",
 1713:   "How does it feel?": "",
 1714:   "Let's be reasonable.": "",
 1715:   "Let's settle this the old-fashioned way.": "",
 1716:   "Hmmph!": "",
 1717:   "It's of no consequence! I'll just run a 75%-off sale and all my customers will come crawling back to me, begging for forgiveness! You'll see!": "",
 1718:   "No...not this time...": "",
 1719:   "Gather 'round, everyone!": "",
 1720:   "I remember when I first moved to Pelican Town... This building was active and vibrant.": "",
 1721:   "We worked together to make the town a better place. There was a real sense of community.": "",
 1722:   "George, you always used to do the crossword puzzle while sipping coffee in the community kitchen. Remember?": "",
 1723:   "The good ol' days.": "",
 1724:   "Emily, you wove that custom banner for the Stardew Valley Fair.": "",
 1725:   "I remember you working on that for years!": "",
 1726:   "It... It was a lot of fun... ": "",
 1727:   "Willy!": "",
 1728:   "Me?": "",
 1729:   "Remember when your little crab experiment got out of hand?": "",
 1730:   "Hehe... That I do. We showed up one morning and the place was crawlin' with 'em.": "",
 1731:   "But Gus saved the day with a brilliant idea... A crab leg feast for the entire valley!": "",
 1732:   "I still dream of that garlic butter.": "",
 1733:   "Mmmmm...": "",
 1734:   "You see, everyone? Our community is what makes Pelican Town special.": "",
 1735:   "When JojaMart came to town we lost sight of that.": "",
 1736:   "But now, thanks to @player, we have a second chance.": "",
 1737:   "I'm asking that you join me in boycotting JojaMart! We have the power to reclaim our old way of life!": "",
 1738:   "Who's with me?": "",
 1739:   "I've lived here too long to see this town go to ruin.": "",
 1740:   "You can count me in!": "",
 1741:   "I'm in.": "",
 1742:   "Boycott!": "",
 1743:   "Me too!": "",

    5:   "Radish Salad! There's nothing like a fresh, peppery radish. It reminds me of the late spring... my mother would slice up our fresh radishes and serve them on grainy bread with a little salt and pepper. Ah, those were the days... but I digress. Now, watch closely...": "",

But before we create the dough we'll need to activate our yeast. They prefer warm water and little something to feed on. I use plain sugar, but honey or maple syrup will do!": "",

   29:   "Crab Cakes! Crab meat is very flimsy on its own, but mixing it with bread crumbs and egg is a great way to give them some body. That's why these cakes are my favorite way to eat crab! But before you go cracking any shells, stay tuned for my essential seasoning mixture...": "",
   30:   "Fiddlehead Risotto! Fiddlehead ferns are beautiful, but actually quite bland on their own. That's why you have to pay careful attention to the spices you add. I'll be honest, it's not very easy to make a good fiddlehead risotto. But with my help, you'll have the best chance at achieving it.": "",
   31:   "Poppyseed Muffin! Poppies make beautiful ornamental flowers... but why not make full use of the plant with these delightful muffins? I'm a huge fan of poppy seeds. They're subtle, but they add a nice flavor and a great texture to bready desserts. And they're healthy!": "",
   32:   "Lobster Bisque! You could serve this one to the governer himself. It's rich, creamy and delicious, with just the right amount of oceanic flavor. The hardest part is finding some lobster, but I'm sure you can do it. Heck, if you're feeling crafty you could catch one yourself with a crab pot!": "",
   33:   "Bruschetta! It's a wonderfully simple appetizer that really showcases the quality of the ingredients. You'll need bread, tomato, and oil. First, you'll need to grill the bread. Slice the tomato and place onto the grilled bread. Then drizzle with oil and serve. I told you it was simple!": "",

Pufferfish, found in the ocean in the early afternoon. And Octopus, found in the ocean during the morning. Catch them while you can!": "",

   54:   "Summer's known for its lightning storms. If you know how to craft a lightning rod, you can harvest the electricity and create battery packs. These can be sold or used for crafting!": "",

   56:   "Fall's almost here! It's arguably the most lucrative season for farmers, so make sure you're saving some money to buy new seeds. If you haven't upgraded your watering can by now, it's probably a good idea.": "",
   57:   "Let's talk sunflowers. When you harvest them you'll not only get a nice flower, but you'll likely get some seeds as well. You can replant those seeds or sell them. I'm sold!": "",

   59:   "If you're a farmer in a small town, it's likely you'll be invited to create a \"grange display\" at some point.

Fish, minerals, artisan goods, fruit, and vegetables are all good to have!": "",

   61:   "Got any tappers? Crafty foragers known how to build 'em. You can attach them to the wild trees that grow all over. Maple trees yield maple syrup, oak trees provide resin, and pine trees produce pine tar. Syrup's the most valuable but all tree products have their uses!": "",
   62:   "Winter's almost here. Make sure you have enough hay stored up to feed your animals over the winter, when all the grass dies out. Each silo can hold 240 pieces of hay, so make sure to do the math and figure out if you need to build any more!": "",
   63:   "Fish Focus: Walleye. You can find this fish on rainy evenings during the fall and winter. It can be found in any freshwater location.": "",
   64:   "Winter's coming soon... and that means your farming operations will be coming to a halt. No crops grow in winter, unless you're lucky enough to have a greenhouse. But there's still plenty to do! More next time.": "",
   65:   "Winter... A time when all the world goes quiet.  Now's a great time to do some mining, fishing and gathering. Upgrade your tools in preparation for a productive spring.

Of course, there's rumors of extremely rare and uniquefish that can only be found in particular seasons, but I don't have any information on them.": "",
   69:   "Let's talk geodes. Geodes are hollow stones that often contain valuable minerals. A blacksmith can crack them open for you for a fee.

   70:   "If you really want to make someone happy, give them their favorite gift on their birthday! Trust me.": "",
   71:   "Ever see three little brown stems poking up out of the ground? They're hard to spot, sometimes. But if you dig on that spot, you'll always find something. Don't ask me how it works.": "",
   72:   "Ever had the urge to dig around in your neighbor's trash? Ew! Hey, if that's your thing, just don't do it when anyone's around. If they notice you, they'll be seriously grossed out, and it'll harm your friendship. Well, unless they're into the same thing.": "",
   73:   "Well, a new year has arrived. Keep your eyes peeled for any new kinds of seeds being stocked in your local general store. Hopefully you upgraded your tools during the winter and you're ready for a productive year!": "",
   74:   "Fish Focus: Eel. Eels can be caught from the ocean in the spring and fall, during rainy evenings.": "",
   75:   "Got a kitchen? Cooking is a great way to enhance your abilities. Not only do they provide a convenient source of energy, but many dishes temporarily increase your skills, speed, and more! Smells good, don't it?": "",
   76:   "Item Spotlight: Crab Pot. Experienced anglers know how to craft crab pots. Despite the name, the pots can be used to catch a wide variety of aquatic critters, in both fresh and salt water. Just place your crab pot in the water and load with bait. Come back the next day and check on it to see what you caught. You'll need to load it with bait again to catch more.": "",
   77:   "It's salmonberry season! All across the countryside, bushes are teeming with juicy little berries, and they're free for the taking! Harvesting them is a great way to earn some extra cash.": "",
   78:   "Let's talk honey. No, not you, silly. I'm talking about the sweet product made by our friends, the bees. Here's the thing... if you've got some flowers blooming near your beehouse your bees can produce flavored honey. Otherwise you'll only get 'wild honey'. Pretty sweet, huh?": "",
   79:   "Here's a tip for you adventurers out there... don't forget your weapon's special attack! Swords can block incoming attacks, which is very useful when slimes are jumping at you. Clubs can pound the ground, sending enemies flying... and with a dagger you can perform a super-quick triple-strike attack! Be safe.": "",
   80:   "I'd like to talk about the famous Adventurer's Guild near Pelican Town. The guild leader, Marlon, has a nice rewards program for anyone brave enough to slay monsters in the local caves. Adventurers will receive powerful items in exchange for slaying large quantites of monsters. There's a poster on the wall with more details. Very cool!": "",
   81:   "I've heard that some folks stand near moving trains to gather any debris that falls off. Wow... the things people will do for a freebie!": "",
   82:   "Animal Spotlight: Pig.^^In these parts, pigs are trained to sniff out valuable truffles. You've got to let the porkers outside and be patient... they'll work their magic when they're good and ready. Make oil out of the truffles to maximize your profit.": "",
   83:   "Here's a reminder of the fish you can only find in summer: Dorado, found in forest rivers during the day. Rainbow Trout, found in forest rivers and in the mountains during the day. Pufferfish, found in the ocean in the early afternoon. And Octopus, found in the ocean during the morning. Catch them while you can!": "",
   84:   "Fish Focus: Super Cucumber. You can find this rare fish in the ocean. It only comes out in the evening, during summer and winter.": "",
   85:   "I know it's hard... but stop worrying so much about your horse! You can leave them anywhere and they'll make their way back home. They're very smart and independent animals!": "",
   86:   "Here's an idea... start a wild tree orchard! Put tappers on those trees and harvest the valuable syrup. Or don't! See if I care.": "",
   87:   "Item Spotlight: Keg. The classic use of a keg is to make wine out of grapes. But did you know you can make wine out of any fruit? Yep.^You can also make juice out of veggies.": "",
   88:   "Do you have a journal? Don't forget to check it from time to time. It's easy to forget that you've written something important down.": "",
   89:   "If you managed to get your hands on a 'rare seed', now's the time to plant it. Although it's said to take all season to grow, reliable sources have told me it actually takes just 24 days. The end result is rumored to be the sweetest fruit in the entire world.": "",
   90:   "It's blackberry season! Bushes across the countryside are overflowing with ripe fruit. Just go outside and see for yourself!": "",
   91:   "Some farmers have reported strange things happening when large fields of cauliflower, melon, or pumpkin reach maturity. Hmmm. I can't verify it, myself.": "",
   92:   "Looking to get married? You're going to need a Mermaid's Pendant. Everyone this side of the Gem Sea knows what it means when you give them a Mermaid's Pendant.^Getting your hands on such a pendant can be tricky. Every region seems to have their own custom, but it always has something to do with the beach or ocean.": "",
   93:   "Item Spotlight: Recycling Machine. Have you been catching a lot of junk while fishing? It's all too common in this day and age. Well, with a recycling machine you can turn those items into something useful. Just place your trash items into the machine and let it do it's thing. Each type of trash produces different kinds of items.": "",
   94:   "Fish Focus: Albacore. This fish can be found either early in the morning or at night. Look for it in the ocean in fall or winter.": "",
   95:   "Fish Focus: Woodskip, sandfish, and scorpion carp. The woodskip is said to only live deep in the woods. The sandfish and scorpion carp can only be found in desert oases.": "",
   96:   "It's just a couple days until communities around the Ferngill Republic celebrate Spirit's Eve! One tradition you may not know of is the search for the golden pumpkin.

 3371:     "We should raise more slimes... In big quantities they can be pretty profitable. And they're so easy to raise.": "",

 3376:     "Don't worry, I already fed the kids... @key spilled the chocolate milk all over my shirt again.": "",

 3385:     "You always look great, even after slopping around in the yard all day.": "",
 3386:     "I don't often show it, but I'm really happy that I'm your husband. Marrying you was the best decision I ever made.": "",
 3387:     "You don't ever have to worry about me. I like to spend a lot of time alone.": "",
 3388:     "Sometimes I feel so angry... but when you show up I always start to calm down.": "",
 3389:     "Maybe I'll mellow out with age.": "",
 3390:     "I know you're tough, but I still worry about you, sometimes. Don't ever go monster hunting without a life elixir and some sturdy boots, okay?": "",
 3391:     "I don't really feel like doing work today. Maybe I'll see what's on TV.": "",
 3392:     "I don't really need friends. You're the only person I need in my life. Is that weird?": "",
 3393:     "I guess I'm not like most people.": "",

 3397:     "I guess I can do the laundry today... You probably have your hands full with running the farm.": "",
 3398:     "Are we doing okay on money? I don't want to have to sell my laptop...": "",
 3399:     "If you need to go see your friends in town, go ahead. I like being alone, anyways.": "",
 3400:     "House-cleaning isn't fun, but when I listen to music and it goes by pretty fast.": "",
 3401:     "Look, I just want to be alone. Why don't you go outside and do your own thing for a while?": "",
 3402:     "What do you want? You sound like my step-dad. Go away.": "",

    3:   "Stir Fry! It's a perfect way to get some healthy greens on your plate. Sautee the greens in a little sesame oil and make sure to add plenty of fresh ginger and garlic. Now breathe deeply... Oh, that's good.": "",
    4:   "Coleslaw! Envisioning bland mounds of limp cabbage? You're not alone. But a great coleslaw can be so much more. Make sure you have juicy fresh cabbage for this one. Toss with a little vinegar and mayonnaise and you're all set. Ah, that's crisp.": "",
    5:   "Radish Salad! There's nothing like a fresh, peppery radish. It reminds me of the late spring... my mother would slice up our fresh radishes and serve them on grainy bread with a little salt and pepper. Ah, those were the days... but I digress. Now, watch closely...": "",
    6:   "Omelet! This is such a simple dish, but so often done incorrectly! A perfect omelet is a thing of beauty. It's a pure golden angel of gleaming egg, and I'm going to show you my secret method...": "",
    7:   "Baked Fish! Whenever I make this one at home, my two cats go bananas. I need a second chef around just to keep them from hopping on the counter for a bite! Just make sure the fish is fresh, preferably caught with your own rod! Now watch as I place the fish on a bed of spring greens...": "",
    8:   "Pancakes! Sometimes I get carried away with fancy, complicated dishes... but there's something comforting about a simple pancake. You'll want plenty of butter and maple syrup to slather over these warm stacks... mmmm....": "",
    9:   "Maki Roll! The delicate flavor of the ocean, sealed within a pillowy cloud of rice. Maybe a bit of wasabi for the adventurous. My mouth is watering as we speak. Oh, how I love sushi...": "",
   10:   "Bread! Breadmaking can be a very complex form of art, but I'll make it simple for you. The most important ingredient is flour, of course. But before we create the dough we'll need to activate our yeast. They prefer warm water and little something to feed on. I use plain sugar, but honey or maple syrup will do!": "",
   11:   "Tortillas! How many of you are gnawing on a microwaved convenience-burrito while watching this program? Shame on you! You might as well wrap your beans in an old wash rag. Now, listen up. Once you've tried my fresh, rustic corn tortillas you'll never go back...": "",
   12:   "Trout Soup! There's something about fresh-caught trout that just gets me buzzing. Maybe it's the subtle taste of the river. At any rate, I've got a wonderful trout soup recipe to share with you today...": "",
   13:   "Glazed Yams! It's yam season, and what better way to enjoy these delightful tubers than by slathering them in a sweet, sticky glaze? You'll need a nice, ripe yam and a whole bunch of sugar. Now, here's how you do it...": "",
   14:   "Artichoke Dip! This is a delightful way to get more artichokes into your body. Personally, I don't even dip anything in there. I just guzzle the sauce down like it's a milkshake. Delicious.": "",
   15:   "Plum Pudding! Little Jack Horner is chomping at the bit for this ooey-gooey delight. And who can blame him? The plums are floral and sweet, with just the right amount of tartness to fully activate every last one of your eager taste buds. You'll just have to try it and see for yourself...": "",
   16:   "Chocolate Cake! What better way to spend these cold winter nights than digging your way through a rich chocolate mountain? With my help, you'll be well on your way to creating the finest cake you've ever laid eyes on. Now, you're going to need a lot of sugar...": "",
   17:   "Pumpkin Pie! In my house, it's a tradition to eat pumpkin pie during the feast of the winter star. The season just isn't complete without that wonderful flavor you can only achieve with the finest farm-fresh pumpkins. A little nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove will sweep you off to a land of crimson and gold...": "",
   18:   "Cranberry Candy! Here's a fun one to help you celebrate the new year. Cranberries are quite bitter on their own, but submerge them in an ocean of sugar and they'll taste like angel's tears. Here's how you do it...": "",
   19:   "Pizza! There's a reason pizza is a timeless culinary classic. You've got an artisan golden-brwn crust, you've got a tangy, garlic-infused marinara sauce, and you're topping it all with a mouth-watering three-cheese blend. And we're just getting started! Let's throw some fresh pepper and tomato on the top. Oh, my!": "",
   20:   "Hashbrowns! This one's simple, but that's a good thing! You'll just want to shred some potatoes, add a liberal amount of salt, and fry to perfection in your favorite high-heat oil. Sounds easy, right? Well, I've got some pointers that'll make your job a lot easier...": "",
   21:   "Complete Breakfast! Last week I taught you how to make hashbrowns. This week I'll show you how to combine them with other ingredients to create a hearty complete breakfast. This meal will really fill you up and give you the energy you need to get in a hard day's work.": "",
   22:   "Lucky Lunch! An old legend has it that this meal is irresistable to spirits of luck and fortune. After consuming it, you're likely to attract a good spirit into your belly, where it will bless you with good fortune until the meal is digested! Sounds weird, huh? I can't say I believe it, but the meal is delicious nonetheless!": "",
   23:   "Hey, ever have a bunch of carp laying around and no idea what to do with them? Yeah, me too. Well, I've devised a great solution to this all-too-common problem. I call it... Carp surprise. It's quite easy to make, but you'll need a lot of carp...": "",
   24:   "Maple Bars! Ever notice how the maple bars are always first to disappear from the doughnut box? Perplexing, because your average maple bar tastes like a sweet hockey puck. Agree? Well, just wait until you try my recipe. You can really taste the forest in these bars. Okay, you're going to need real, quality maple syrup...": "",
   25:   "A viewer from Pelican Town wrote to me recently... let's see... Her name's Haley. She wrote, 'I tried your pink cake last time I was in Zuzu City and I fell in love with it. Could you share the recipe on your next episode?'. Well, why not? It's a marvelous cake. And you'll never guess the secret ingredient... melon!": "",
   26:   "Roasted Hazelnuts! I've got a nice old hazelnut tree behind my house, and every year I invite the family over for a nut roasting party! Once we start roasting, it's inevitable that the neighbors will show up. That rich, nutty smell is irresistable. Now, here's the family recipe...": "",
   27:   "Fruit Salad! Here's a healthy and delicious treat to brighten up your day. The most important thing to remember is that you need ripe fruit. Forget the bland stuff they sell at the supermarket... I'm talking fresh-picked, juicy, bursting-with-flavor fruit. Okay, now watch closely...": "",
   28:   "Blackberry Cobbler! This one always reminds me of Stardew Valley. There's a few days in fall where the valley is overflowing with the most delicious blackberries I've ever tasted. If you can get your hands on some, I'd highly recommend them for this simple cobbler.": "",
   29:   "Crab Cakes! Crab meat is very flimsy on its own, but mixing it with bread crumbs and egg is a great way to give them some body. That's why these cakes are my favorite way to eat crab! But before you go cracking any shells, stay tuned for my essential seasoning mixture...": "",
   30:   "Fiddlehead Risotto! Fiddlehead ferns are beautiful, but actually quite bland on their own. That's why you have to pay careful attention to the spices you add. I'll be honest, it's not very easy to make a good fiddlehead risotto. But with my help, you'll have the best chance at achieving it.": "",
   31:   "Poppyseed Muffin! Poppies make beautiful ornamental flowers... but why not make full use of the plant with these delightful muffins? I'm a huge fan of poppy seeds. They're subtle, but they add a nice flavor and a great texture to bready desserts. And they're healthy!": "",
   32:   "Lobster Bisque! You could serve this one to the governer himself. It's rich, creamy and delicious, with just the right amount of oceanic flavor. The hardest part is finding some lobster, but I'm sure you can do it. Heck, if you're feeling crafty you could catch one yourself with a crab pot!": "",
   33:   "Bruschetta! It's a wonderfully simple appetizer that really showcases the quality of the ingredients. You'll need bread, tomato, and oil. First, you'll need to grill the bread. Slice the tomato and place onto the grilled bread. Then drizzle with oil and serve. I told you it was simple!": "",
   34:   "Shrimp Cocktail! Here's another good appetizer for you and your dinner guests. My cocktail sauce is extra zesty, and I'm sure you'll love it. Now, the first step...": "",

   38:   "Hi there, viewers. Every week I travel around the country to meet people from all different walks of life. Together, we'll broaden our horizons and learn about unique careers, lifestyles, and perspectives. I'm Tom Laminar, and you're watching 'Saturday Spotlight'.": "",

   41:   "This one's for all you greenhorns out there: chop wood and search for wild forage to earn some cash while waiting on your first harvest!": "",
   42:   "This one's for you folks living in Stardew Valley. Check for spring onion southwest of town, where the river meets the ocean. You can sometimes find a whole bunch growing right out of the dirt.": "",
   43:   "Let's talk fences. Fences are useful for keeping weeds at bay and protecting your crops. They also let farmers contain their livestock. Fences break down after a while, but stone, iron, and hardwood fences last a lot longer than basic wood!": "",
   44:   "Woes from crows? Sounds like you need a scarecrow! Placing a scarecrow on your farm deters crows from a pretty good distance. Make sure you protect your valuable crops!^One more thing... need a bigger backpack to hold all your stuff? Check your local general store.": "",
   45:   "It's salmonberry season! All across the countryside, bushes are teeming with juicy little berries, and they're free for the taking! Harvesting them is a great way to earn some extra cash.": "",
   46:   "Ah, refreshing rain... a Farmer's best friend! When it rains, you don't have to water your crops. Use this to your advantage!": "",
   47:   "Get your hands on a fishin' pole and sell your catch! Fishing is a great way to make a little extra cash when you have some down time. The distance your bobber lands from any dry land determines what kinds of fish you'll hook... as well as the location, season, time of day, and weather!": "",
   48:   "Fruit trees. They take an entire season to grow, so plan ahead! If the area directly surrounding your new tree isn't clear, it will interfere with growth. Once your fruit tree is mature, it'll produce delicious fruit for you every day while in season. Better start savin' up!": "",
   49:   "Summer's here, along with a whole slew of new crops to plant! Take hops, for example. The vines take a while to grow, but once they're mature they can be harvested every day. Good luck!": "",
   50:   "Here's a rundown of the fish you can only find in summer: Dorado, found in forest rivers during the day. Rainbow Trout, found in forest rivers and in the mountains during the day. Pufferfish, found in the ocean in the early afternoon. And Octopus, found in the ocean during the morning. Catch them while you can!": "",
   51:   "Let's talk corn. It's an unusual crop because it lasts for two seasons! That's right, while most crops die when the season changes, corn lives on. You can grow it in both summer and fall. Now, get out there and plant some corn!": "",
   52:   "Starting tomorrow, an unusual amount of shells and corals are expected to wash up on beaches all around the world. I'm no scientist, but I've heard it's something to do with crab mating season. At any rate, you could make some good coin combing your local beach.": "",
   53:   "Got a spa in your town? Relax and hold still in the steaming hot water to replenish your energy. Ahh... feels good, don't it?": "",
   54:   "Summer's known for its lightning storms. If you know how to craft a lightning rod, you can harvest the electricity and create battery packs. These can be sold or used for crafting!": "",
   55:   "Most towns have a seasonal calendar in front of the general store. It's a good idea to check on that now and then to get a feel for what's going on in the community. Make sure to check for any job postings as well!": "",
   56:   "Fall's almost here! It's arguably the most lucrative season for farmers, so make sure you're saving some money to buy new seeds. If you haven't upgraded your watering can by now, it's probably a good idea.": "",
   57:   "Let's talk sunflowers. When you harvest them you'll not only get a nice flower, but you'll likely get some seeds as well. You can replant those seeds or sell them. I'm sold!": "",
   58:   "It's blackberry season! Bushes across the countryside are overflowing with ripe fruit. Just go outside and see for yourself!": "",
   59:   "If you're a farmer in a small town, it's likely you'll be invited to create a \"grange display\" at some point. Typically, a grange display consists of 9 items that best showcase your talents. Shoot for high quality, high value items and make sure to have a variety as well. Fish, minerals, artisan goods, fruit, and vegetables are all good to have!": "",
   60:   "Fish Focus: Salmon. Salmon return to their spawning ground in fall to lay eggs. That means the rivers are chock-full of them! You can only find them in fall, so get out there and cast your pole.": "",
   61:   "Got any tappers? Crafty foragers known how to build 'em. You can attach them to the wild trees that grow all over. Maple trees yield maple syrup, oak trees provide resin, and pine trees produce pine tar. Syrup's the most valuable but all tree products have their uses!": "",
   62:   "Winter's almost here. Make sure you have enough hay stored up to feed your animals over the winter, when all the grass dies out. Each silo can hold 240 pieces of hay, so make sure to do the math and figure out if you need to build any more!": "",
   63:   "Fish Focus: Walleye. You can find this fish on rainy evenings during the fall and winter. It can be found in any freshwater location.": "",
   64:   "Winter's coming soon... and that means your farming operations will be coming to a halt. No crops grow in winter, unless you're lucky enough to have a greenhouse. But there's still plenty to do! More next time.": "",
   65:   "Winter... A time when all the world goes quiet.  Now's a great time to do some mining, fishing and gathering. Upgrade your tools in preparation for a productive spring. Or get your local carpenter to build something on your farm! Stock up on resources, upgrade, and prepare for the next year.": "",
   66:   "Wondering how to get your hands on 'Refined Quartz'? Just put a regular old quartz in the furnace. You'll need a lump of coal to fuel the fire.": "",
   67:   "Find any tree seeds while chopping wood? You can plant those in the ground and a new tree will grow. Get creative!": "",
   68:   "There's a couple fish you can only find in winter... Squid and Lingcod. Squid can be caught from the ocean in the evening. Lingcod can be found in fresh water all day. Of course, there's rumors of extremely rare and uniquefish that can only be found in particular seasons, but I don't have any information on them.": "",
   69:   "Let's talk geodes. Geodes are hollow stones that often contain valuable minerals. A blacksmith can crack them open for you for a fee. Now, there's different kinds of geodes... and each one yields a different subset of minerals. The rare \"omni-geode\", however, can contain every kind of mineral.": "",
   70:   "If you really want to make someone happy, give them their favorite gift on their birthday! Trust me.": "",
   71:   "Ever see three little brown stems poking up out of the ground? They're hard to spot, sometimes. But if you dig on that spot, you'll always find something. Don't ask me how it works.": "",
   72:   "Ever had the urge to dig around in your neighbor's trash? Ew! Hey, if that's your thing, just don't do it when anyone's around. If they notice you, they'll be seriously grossed out, and it'll harm your friendship. Well, unless they're into the same thing.": "",
   73:   "Well, a new year has arrived. Keep your eyes peeled for any new kinds of seeds being stocked in your local general store. Hopefully you upgraded your tools during the winter and you're ready for a productive year!": "",
   74:   "Fish Focus: Eel. Eels can be caught from the ocean in the spring and fall, during rainy evenings.": "",
   75:   "Got a kitchen? Cooking is a great way to enhance your abilities. Not only do they provide a convenient source of energy, but many dishes temporarily increase your skills, speed, and more! Smells good, don't it?": "",
   76:   "Item Spotlight: Crab Pot. Experienced anglers know how to craft crab pots. Despite the name, the pots can be used to catch a wide variety of aquatic critters, in both fresh and salt water. Just place your crab pot in the water and load with bait. Come back the next day and check on it to see what you caught. You'll need to load it with bait again to catch more.": "",
   77:   "It's salmonberry season! All across the countryside, bushes are teeming with juicy little berries, and they're free for the taking! Harvesting them is a great way to earn some extra cash.": "",
   78:   "Let's talk honey. No, not you, silly. I'm talking about the sweet product made by our friends, the bees. Here's the thing... if you've got some flowers blooming near your beehouse your bees can produce flavored honey. Otherwise you'll only get 'wild honey'. Pretty sweet, huh?": "",
   79:   "Here's a tip for you adventurers out there... don't forget your weapon's special attack! Swords can block incoming attacks, which is very useful when slimes are jumping at you. Clubs can pound the ground, sending enemies flying... and with a dagger you can perform a super-quick triple-strike attack! Be safe.": "",
   80:   "I'd like to talk about the famous Adventurer's Guild near Pelican Town. The guild leader, Marlon, has a nice rewards program for anyone brave enough to slay monsters in the local caves. Adventurers will receive powerful items in exchange for slaying large quantites of monsters. There's a poster on the wall with more details. Very cool!": "",
   81:   "I've heard that some folks stand near moving trains to gather any debris that falls off. Wow... the things people will do for a freebie!": "",
   82:   "Animal Spotlight: Pig.^^In these parts, pigs are trained to sniff out valuable truffles. You've got to let the porkers outside and be patient... they'll work their magic when they're good and ready. Make oil out of the truffles to maximize your profit.": "",
   83:   "Here's a reminder of the fish you can only find in summer: Dorado, found in forest rivers during the day. Rainbow Trout, found in forest rivers and in the mountains during the day. Pufferfish, found in the ocean in the early afternoon. And Octopus, found in the ocean during the morning. Catch them while you can!": "",
   84:   "Fish Focus: Super Cucumber. You can find this rare fish in the ocean. It only comes out in the evening, during summer and winter.": "",
   85:   "I know it's hard... but stop worrying so much about your horse! You can leave them anywhere and they'll make their way back home. They're very smart and independent animals!": "",
   86:   "Here's an idea... start a wild tree orchard! Put tappers on those trees and harvest the valuable syrup. Or don't! See if I care.": "",
   87:   "Item Spotlight: Keg. The classic use of a keg is to make wine out of grapes. But did you know you can make wine out of any fruit? Yep.^You can also make juice out of veggies.": "",
   88:   "Do you have a journal? Don't forget to check it from time to time. It's easy to forget that you've written something important down.": "",
   89:   "If you managed to get your hands on a 'rare seed', now's the time to plant it. Although it's said to take all season to grow, reliable sources have told me it actually takes just 24 days. The end result is rumored to be the sweetest fruit in the entire world.": "",
   90:   "It's blackberry season! Bushes across the countryside are overflowing with ripe fruit. Just go outside and see for yourself!": "",
   91:   "Some farmers have reported strange things happening when large fields of cauliflower, melon, or pumpkin reach maturity. Hmmm. I can't verify it, myself.": "",
   92:   "Looking to get married? You're going to need a Mermaid's Pendant. Everyone this side of the Gem Sea knows what it means when you give them a Mermaid's Pendant.^Getting your hands on such a pendant can be tricky. Every region seems to have their own custom, but it always has something to do with the beach or ocean.": "",
   93:   "Item Spotlight: Recycling Machine. Have you been catching a lot of junk while fishing? It's all too common in this day and age. Well, with a recycling machine you can turn those items into something useful. Just place your trash items into the machine and let it do it's thing. Each type of trash produces different kinds of items.": "",

  138:     "Jas and Vincent weren't behaving very well today. I'm still all wound up...": "",
  139:     "Well, it was just another boring day at the clinic.": "",
  140:     "Hey. Did you have a more exciting day than me? I hope so.": "",

  146:     "Life's a lot different now that we have a child.": "",
  147:     "I already gave @key and @key their breakfast. They were hungry!": "",
  148:     "We have to make sure and give @key a lot of attention now that we have @key. We don't want any jealousy between them.": "",

  166:     "Taking a break? I guess being a farmer is easier than I thought...": "",
  167:     "If you go into town, make sure and say hi to everyone for me.": "",
  168:     "I'll do the laundry tomorrow morning before you get up... that way you won't have any down-time.": "",
  169:     "Are we doing okay on money, @player?": "",
  170:     "I wonder what everyone in town is doing today?": "",
  171:     "I don't really feel like doing anything today.": "",
  172:     "No matter how much I clean, the house keeps getting dirty again.": "",
  173:     "I guess farms can be kind of dirty.": "",
  174:     "I wonder if we'll live here our entire lives?": "",
  175:     "...Do you still love me?": "",
  176:     "*sigh*... Maybe we got married too young.": "",
  177:     "Are you still happy with me?": "",
  178:     "Did I do something wrong? You've been acting different lately.": "",
  179:     "Do you ever wonder what else is out there?": "",
  180:     "You used to be romantic... what happened?": "",
  181:     "I know I'm not as young as I used to be... is that what you married me for?": "",
  182:     "We only have one short life to live... is this the best way to do it?": "",
  183:     "I used to be your sweetie... now you only seem to put up with me when I make a hot dinner.": "",

  194:     "Don't worry, I'll take care of them.": "",
  195:     "This weather feels pretty nice after the heat of summer.": "",

  197:     "Don't worry, I'll take care of it all.": "",
  198:     "Have you figured out what you're going to use for our grange display tomorrow?": "",

  227:     "Breathe deep... can you smell that? That tells me it's mushroom season.": "",
  228:     "It's so peaceful out here on the farm. I never appreciated nature that much living in town.": "",
  229:     "My mother used to always make this delicious pumpkin soup in the fall.": "",
  230:     "I could sure go for some wine.": "",
  231:     "Ah... Fall. The warm sun drifts low in the sky, casting long shadows over waving fields of gold.": "",

  243:     "I think I might do some writing this winter. There's not much else to do, anyway.": "",

 1248:   "Raise your shields.": "",
 1249:   "You successfully block the attack. The skeleton stumbles backward, giving you enough time to strike out and slay the foul creature.": "",
 1250:   "You continue down the hallway, taking care not to step on the skeleton's remains.": "",
 1251:   "The skeleton is too quick, and strikes out at your party before anyone has a chance to attack!": "",
 1252:   "The force of the blow sends your party flying backwards. Unable to stop in time, you tumble down a steep slope and splash into something wet.": "",
 1253:   "You turn and run along a dim corridor. The cold stone slopes and spirals downward for what seems like an eternity. Finally, you emerge into a new area.": "",
 1254:   "After searching around the base of the tower, you discover a trapdoor hidden in the brush. Beneath is a ladder, which your party descends.": "",
 1255:   "You find yourself in a sewer-like corridor. To your left, a hallway glows with a peculiar green light. To your right, a staircase leads up into the dark.": "",
 1256:   "What do you do?": "",
 1257:   "Enter the hallway to your left.": "",
 1258:   "Climb the stairs to your right.": "",
 1259:   "You are in a room. On your left is a ladder. On your right, three prisoners are floating in strange, glowing capsules. They appear to be in the process of some kind of transformation.": "",

 1261:   "What do you do?": "",
 1262:   "Leave as quickly as possible.": "",

 1266:   "The time has come to face Dreadlord Xarth.": "",
 1267:   "Xarth: Intruders? How dare you tresspass in my private chambers!": "",
 1268:   "Ah, so you've come for the Solarion Staff...": "",
 1269:   "Hehehe... fools. You'll make a nice addition to my skeleton army!": "",

 1287:   "Xarth sends bolts of pure dark energy flying. One of them strikes Sebastian, but your 'Shield Charm' reflects it back into Xarth's face!": "",
 1288:   "Xarth is defeated, and the Solarion Staff glows peacefully. Order has been restored to the world.": "",
 1289:   "Before you have a chance to cast your spell, Xarth sends a shadow beam at your companions!": "",
 1290:   "Sam and Sebastian are fried to a crisp...": "",
 1291:   "Your spell hits Xarth square in the face.": "",

 1303:   "The Solarion Staff glows peacefully as you hold it high. Order has been restored to the world!": "",
 1304:   "Putting the disturbing sight of the prisoners out of your mind, you and your companions quickly climb the ladder.": "",

 1515:   "Hey! I want you to be in this shot... okay?": "",
 1516:   "Just walk by Clint and Emily in the background while they're talking... It'll give the scene a little more authenticity.": "",
 1517:   "Okay... Ready?": "",

 1519:   "I thought we had something special... You said you wouldn't leave me for anything. I guess that was a lie.": "",

 1521:   "I've just got to try new 'Joja Bluu' cola.": "",
 1522:   "It's got three times the sorbitol for a thick, sweet blast. And it's cheaper than water!": "",

 1540:   "You see, my father wasn't a good guy... He... Well, he ruined everything for me and my mom.": "",
 1541:   "Half the time he was gone... The other half he'd drink all night and tell me I'm worthless, that I'd never amount to anything.": "",
 1542:   "I think he resented me for being young... Bitter because he'd wasted his youth doing nothing and had gotten nowhere in life.": "",
 1543:   "Well... that's my take on it, anyway. Who knows what was going on in his mind.": "",
 1544:   "One day he left, and soon after that Mom got sick and passed away. I had no choice but to move in with my grandparents.": "",

 1558:   "You know what? There's no sense dwelling on this stuff... I don't want any sympathy from anyone.": "",
 1559:   "You have to look on the positive side of things... My childhood wasn't great, but it did make me strong. I had to be.": "",

 1564:   "There you go!": "",
 1565:   "Hmmph. I could've done it myself! And I can certainly move around on my own!": "",
 1566:   "How feeble do you think I am?": "",
 1567:   "@player? You were watching us?": "",
 1568:   "I was. You did a kind thing there, Penny.": "",
 1569:   "You should've left him alone. Now he's grumpy.": "",
 1570:   "I'm just taking a walk, minding my own business.": "",
 1571:   "*sigh*...No, no... I'm sorry, miss. I shouldn't have gotten so angry.": "",
 1572:   "It was actually very kind of you to help me out.": "",
 1573:   "That's okay, Mr. Mullner. I understand.": "",
 1574:   "It must be difficult to grow old...": "",
 1575:   "I'd rather not think about it.": "",
 1576:   "It's just a different part of life.": "",
 1577:   "That's why we should respect our elders.": "",
 1578:   "I'd rather die young...": "",
 1579:   "Well, it was interesting talking to you, @player. I should go.": "",
 1580:   "Hey! What do you think you're doing? That's private property!": "",
 1581:   "Sam!": "",
 1582:   "Uh... Er... I... I'm sorry, sir.": "",
 1583:   "*sigh*... The youth these days... Sometimes I wonder if this town isn't doomed.": "",
 1584:   "You saw what happened, @player. What do you have to say about this?": "",
 1585:   "You're right, sir. Sam should respect private property.": "",
 1586:   "Don't blame Sam. There's nowhere else for him to ride!": "",
 1587:   "I'm staying out of this.": "",
 1588:   "Fine! I just won't ride my skateboard ever again. Happy?": "",
 1589:   "Exactly! If there was a park in town, I could ride there and everyone would be happy.": "",
 1590:   "Hmmph. Alright.": "",
 1591:   "You're being difficult, Sam. I have no problem with you riding around town, just try not to cause any damage! It's that simple.": "",
 1592:   "Hmmph. I thought you were more mature than this, @player.": "",
 1593:   "I'll let it slide this time, Sam. But I don't want to see you doing this anymore.": "",
 1594:   "Got it?": "",
 1595:   "Sam... I'm sorry I yelled at you. Just please try not to damage anything in the future. Got it?": "",
 1596:   "Got it?": "",
 1597:   "Yes, sir.": "",
 1598:   "...Did you see that trick, though? That was rad.": "",
 1599:   "@player! You're here!": "",
 1600:   "Okay... I guess I'd better introduce my pieces. Wish me luck!": "",
 1601:   "Umm... Okay everyone!": "",
 1602:   "Thanks for coming to my art show.": "",
 1603:   "As some of you know, I came to this town because I wanted to draw inspiration from the beautiful surroundings.": "",
 1604:   "This place really feels like home now.": "",
 1605:   "Okay. I'm going to introduce my sculptures now.": "",
 1606:   "I haven't named this one, yet. She started out as an exercise in human anatomy, but I ended up seeing her through to completion.": "",
 1607:   "Her expression is intentionally unclear... is she embarrassed, amused, pained? I'll leave that for you to decide.": "",
 1608:   "This one's called 'Post-Dimensional Nullspace'. It represents the boundary of human imagination.": "",
 1609:   "The shape and color came to me vividly when I was in a 'trance state'.": "",
 1610:   "I've been calling this one 'Egg Heads'. I wanted to create an animatronic humanoid statue to toy with the viewer's ability to properly attribute personhood to a physical entity.": "",
 1611:   "And the last one is called 'Wood Sculpture 3'. It's a celebration of my favorite sculpting material... wood.": "",
 1612:   "Well, those are my sculptures!": "",
 1613:   "Oh! One last thing.": "",
 1614:   "I'd like to say thanks to my special friend, @player.": "",
 1615:   "He gave me the idea for this show and the courage to go through with it. I know that sounds cheesy, but it's true.": "",
 1616:   "She gave me the idea for this show and the courage to go through with it. I know that sounds cheesy, but it's true.": "",
 1617:   "I'm proud of you, Leah! Events like this really breathe life into our little town!": "",
 1618:   "Great stuff!": "",
 1619:   "I love your art, Leah! 'Post-Dimensional Nullspace' is my favorite.": "",
 1620:   "Great use of wood!": "",
 1621:   "Thanks for doing this!": "",
 1622:   "Thanks, everyone!": "",
 1623:   "Now let's start the bidding on these wonderful art pieces... A marvelous addition to your home!": "",
 1624:   "Do I hear 5000g for the pink one?": "",
 1625:   "Wow! I'm exhausted.": "",
 1626:   "My show was a real success, wasn't it?": "",
 1627:   "Marnie... we can't. If word got out, it could undermine my position of authority in the town!": "",
 1628:   "You understand... don't you?": "",
 1629:   "You care too much about your job, Lewis. There are other things to life, you know.": "",
 1630:   "...but yes, I understand. I guess we'll have to keep...us...a secret.": "",
 1631:   "Gahh!": "",
 1632:   "@player...You overheard everything, didn't you?": "",
 1633:   "Yes... but I'll keep it a secret.": "",
 1634:   "Yes... and I'm going to tell everyone.": "",
 1635:   "Why were you hiding there, anyway?": "",
 1636:   "@player!": "",
 1637:   "...You caught me.": "",
 1638:   "I was planning to ask Emily on a date. I was at her doorstep and everything... but then I heard her coming and I dove into this bush.": "",
 1639:   "Now I'm waiting until she's done talking with Caroline so I can sneak back into my house.": "",
 1640:   "What did you just say? You'll never upgrade your tools again if I don't ask her out?": "",
 1641:   "You're a villain, @player.": "",
 1642:   "*sigh* ...alright, I'll do it.": "",
 1643:   "I gotta remember that advice @player gave me in the saloon.": "",
 1644:   "Um... Emily?": "",
 1645:   "Sorry, Caroline. Could you excuse me for a minute?": "",
 1646:   "Yes, Clint?": "",
 1647:   "I was wondering if you'd go w... with... tomorrow, me... *gulp*": "",
 1648:   "I've got two tickets for the Grampleton Carnival tomorrow. W... Would you go with me? ": "",
 1649:   "Sure, Clint! That sounds fun!": "",
 1650:   "Really? Okay! I'll pick you up at five.": "",
 1651:   "Okay! See you tomorrow!": "",
 1652:   "Did you see that?! I've got a date tomorrow night!": "",
 1653:   "Oh man...I'm so nervous.": "",
 1654:   "Thanks for forcing me to do that, earlier. I'm scared, but also very pleased.": "",
 1655:   "Hi @player.": "",
 1656:   "I wanted to talk to you in private...": "",
 1657:   "It's kinda cold out here though... let's sneak into my room.": "",
 1658:   "So... @player.": "",
 1659:   "I know I've been talking about nothing but the band for a while now... But I don't want you to think that's all I'm interested in.": "",
 1660:   "Um... Er... What I mean is...": "",
 1661:   "Well, I'm really happy that we've grown so close... Heh.": "",
 1662:   "@player... do you think of me as... just a friend?": "",
 1663:   "Sam? I'm coming in!": "",
 1664:   "Quick! Hide in the bed!": "",
 1665:   "What's wrong, Honey? Were you doing something... bad?": "",
 1666:   "I thought I heard some weird sounds coming from your room...": "",
 1667:   "No Mom! I was just... doing push-ups! I wanna beat Dad at arm-wrestling some day! ...heh.": "",
 1668:   "Oh! *giggle*... That explains why you're all red and sweaty.": "",
 1669:   "Okay, well good luck. I'll see you in the morning.": "",
 1670:   "Goodnight, Mom.": "",
 1671:   "Whew... That was close.": "",

 1673:   "Get out of the bed.": "",
 1674:   "Stay put.": "",
 1675:   "Earlier, I was trying to say... that I really like you, @player. I think we could really have something special together... Know what I mean?": "",
 1676:   "Alright, I said it.": "",
 1677:   "Move closer to Sam.": "",
 1678:   "Head for the window.": "",

 1684:   "It used to be the pride and joy of the town... always bustling with activity.": "",
 1685:   "Now... just look at it. It's shameful.": "",
 1686:   "These days, the young folk would rather sit in front of the TV than engage with the community.": "",
 1687:   "But listen to me, I sound like an old fool.": "",
 1688:   "Joja Corporation has been hounding me to sell them the land so they can turn it into a warehouse...": "",
 1689:   "Pelican Town could use the money, but there's something stopping me from selling it... I guess old timers like me get attached to relics of the past... Ah well.": "",
 1690:   "If anyone else buys a Joja Co. Membership I'm just gonna go ahead and sell it.": "",

 1700:   "Hey. I'll keep this place unlocked from now on... maybe you can help catch that rat if you have some extra time.": "",
 1701:   "Strange...": "",
 1702:   "I'll have to come back and explore this building further.": "",
 1703:   "I'm not sure how you did it, @player... but the community center has never looked better!": "",
 1704:   "You've done Pelican Town a great service. Everyone in town is pleased.": "",
 1705:   "As a way of saying 'Thank You', I'd like to present you with this Town's greatest honor... The Stardew Hero Award. You've earned it!": "",

    5:   "Radish Salad! There's nothing like a fresh, peppery radish. It reminds me of the late spring... my mother would slice up our fresh radishes and serve them on grainy bread with a little salt and pepper. Ah, those were the days... but I digress. Now, watch closely...": "",

But before we create the dough we'll need to activate our yeast. They prefer warm water and little something to feed on. I use plain sugar, but honey or maple syrup will do!": "",

You've got an artisan golden-brwn crust, you've got a tangy, garlic-infused marinara sauce, and you're topping it all with a mouth-watering three-cheese blend. And we're just getting started!

After consuming it, you're likely to attract a good spirit into your belly, where it will bless you with good fortune until the meal is digested! Sounds weird, huh? I can't say I believe it, but the meal is delicious nonetheless!": "",

   24:   "Maple Bars! Ever notice how the maple bars are always first to disappear from the doughnut box? Perplexing, because your average maple bar tastes like a sweet hockey puck. Agree?

   27:   "Fruit Salad! Here's a healthy and delicious treat to brighten up your day. The most important thing to remember is that you need ripe fruit. Forget the bland stuff they sell at the supermarket... I'm talking fresh-picked, juicy, bursting-with-flavor fruit. Okay, now watch closely...": "",

   29:   "Crab Cakes! Crab meat is very flimsy on its own, but mixing it with bread crumbs and egg is a great way to give them some body. That's why these cakes are my favorite way to eat crab! But before you go cracking any shells, stay tuned for my essential seasoning mixture...": "",
   30:   "Fiddlehead Risotto! Fiddlehead ferns are beautiful, but actually quite bland on their own. That's why you have to pay careful attention to the spices you add. I'll be honest, it's not very easy to make a good fiddlehead risotto. But with my help, you'll have the best chance at achieving it.": "",
   31:   "Poppyseed Muffin! Poppies make beautiful ornamental flowers... but why not make full use of the plant with these delightful muffins? I'm a huge fan of poppy seeds. They're subtle, but they add a nice flavor and a great texture to bready desserts. And they're healthy!": "",
   32:   "Lobster Bisque! You could serve this one to the governer himself. It's rich, creamy and delicious, with just the right amount of oceanic flavor. The hardest part is finding some lobster, but I'm sure you can do it. Heck, if you're feeling crafty you could catch one yourself with a crab pot!": "",
   33:   "Bruschetta! It's a wonderfully simple appetizer that really showcases the quality of the ingredients. You'll need bread, tomato, and oil. First, you'll need to grill the bread. Slice the tomato and place onto the grilled bread. Then drizzle with oil and serve. I told you it was simple!": "",

   48:   "Fruit trees. They take an entire season to grow, so plan ahead! If the area directly surrounding your new tree isn't clear, it will interfere with growth. Once your fruit tree is mature, it'll produce delicious fruit for you every day while in season. Better start savin' up!": "",
