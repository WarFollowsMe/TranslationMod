    "Any dinner requests for tonight?": "",
    "Despite all the technology we have, a rainy day is still the best tool for watering crops.": "",

    "Oh... the smell? I tried to do some baking... It didn't work out too well.": "",
    "How was your day today, dear? Muddy?": "",
    "Hi, honey. I'm so glad you're home. I was starting to get kind of lonely.": "",
    "Hi. It's good to see you.": "",
    "I spent the day skimming through some medical journals.": "",

    "I've got some chores to do in here.": "",
    "Did you have any strange dreams last night?": "",
    "I did, but all I remember is that it had something to do with a @key @key. Weird.": "",
    "Hehe. Dreams don't mean anything... do they, Honey?": "",
    "Well, we can't spend all day chit-chatting. You have work to do!": "",
    "Good morning, dear. Another day of farm chores, huh?": "",
    "I'll be cheering for you. <": "",
    "If you ever want to talk about how to maximize crop yield or anything... I'm open to that!": "",
    "There's always something new happening on our farm... I love it.": "",
    "This place is so big compared to the trailer, I feel overwhelmed... In a good way!": "",
    "Mind if I add some architectural flair to the woodwork around here? My chisel hand is itching!": "",
    "I always feel happy on a sunny day.": "",
    "The sky looks great today... so clear!": "",
    "From now on, I'm only going to go into the clinic when I have appointments. Otherwise I can just work from home!": "",

    "I'm ready for bed whenever you are.": "",
    "Wow, you look like you did a lot of work today.": "",
    "Now you should just relax and kick back for the night.": "",

    "So, tell me about your day.": "",
    "...": "",
    "You look like you're ready for bed, @player. Should I lull you to sleep with the technical details of my latest project?": "",
    "*yawn*... To be honest, I'm kind of sleepy too.": "",
    "Are you ready for bed soon? I turned on the electric blanket for us...": "",
    "Hi there, honey. Ready to spend a quiet evening at home?": "",
    "It's so quiet and peaceful in the evening. Nothing to distract you from the experience of living.": "",
    "You look like you've been working hard, dear. Let me help you de-stress.": "",

    "Hi, @player. Good to see you. It's comforting when you're around.": "",
    "My arms feel a little restless... How about a nice, deep massage?": "",
    "I feel exhausted... That's a good sign! It means I worked hard enough today.": "",
    "You always smell so good after a day of hard work. It's your natural musk!": "",
    "You smell sweet, my dear. Like a honeycomb drifting on a pool of spice tea.": "",
    "Come here, let me massage your back. You look tense.": "",
    "You smell sweet, my dear. Like a cinnamon leaf floating in the summer breeze.": "",
    "I wonder if the moon is visible tonight?": "",
    "So, did you get everything done on the farm today? If you didn't I won't be mad!": "",
    "It's a beautiful day today, isn't it?": "",
    "Days like this make work a little more pleasant.": "",
    "I'm just going to relax and inspect the farm today, okay?": "",
    "It's just such a nice-looking area.": "",
    "Hi, honey! If I knew more about farm work I'd help you out more. Sorry!": "",
    "I'll be thinking of you.": "",
    "I'm just going to do some dusting over here. That should help you out, right?": "",
    "*phew*... it's hot out here.": "",
    "Don't overwork yourself, dear.": "",
    "Make sure and take a break every now and then, or get something to eat.": "",
    "I like being out here. It's a good place to think about new inventions.": "",
    "I'm still hoping to come up with something to help you out in your work.": "",
    "I'm just going to hang out here, okay?": "",
    "There's a lot of interesting bugs and things out here. *chuckle*": "",
    "Looks like a good day to work on my tan, don't you think, sweetheart?": "",

    "This is the life I've always dreamed of.": "",
    "I'm really happy on our little farm, @player.": "",
    "This is so different from my old life, but I'm really starting to like it.": "",
    "I feel like I really belong here.": "",
    "This is so much nicer than being cooped up in the clinic all day.": "",
    "I love watching you on the farm... hehe": "",
    "Today, I'm going to continue writing my new novel. What better place than our wonderful farm?": "",
    "This is perfect.": "",
    "I'm going to get a bunch of exercise today! Haha! I love living on a farm.": "",
    "Hey, look at those puffy clouds in the sky, honey!": "",
    "I'm going to watch those for a while, if you don't mind.": "",
    "I have to go into the clinic today. Have a nice day, okay?": "",
    "I have to go into town today. Don't work too hard, and eat something good for lunch!": "",
    "I have to leave for work soon. I'll see you tonight. I'll be thinking of you!": "",
    "Hi, honey. How was your day?": "",
    "*Phew*... I'm exhausted...": "",
    "My patients are still healthy, so it was a good day.": "",
    "Good evening. My day was fine, thanks! How was yours?": "",
    "Jas and Vincent weren't behaving very well today. I'm still all wound up...": "",
    "Well, it was just another boring day at the clinic.": "",
    "Hey. Did you have a more exciting day than me? I hope so.": "",
    "Well, It's time to kick back and relax. Did you leave me any dinner?": "",
    "I'm just looking forward to bed-time.": "",
    "Have you spent any time with @key today?": "",
    "I wonder if @key will grow up to be a farmer like you?": "",
    "Don't worry, I'll feed @key today. You can just focus on running the farm.": "",
    "Life's a lot different now that we have a child.": "",
    "I already gave @key and @key their breakfast. They were hungry!": "",
    "We have to make sure and give @key a lot of attention now that we have @key. We don't want any jealousy between them.": "",
    "You know, I think @key has your nose.": "",
    "A nice house, two wonderful kids, and a beautiful plot of land. What's left?": "",
    "It's hard to believe we're finally married...": "",
    "You know, I always had a feeling we'd be together some day.": "",
    "Are you enjoying the married life, @player?": "",
    "I am.": "",
    "Wow, you look really handsome today!": "",
    "Wow, you look beautiful today.": "",
    "This place is my home now... I'm happy here.": "",
    "I was just admiring my wedding amulet... The shell is flawless. It must have cost you a fortune!": "",
    "Be careful out there! Sometimes I worry about you falling into a mine shaft.": "",
    "@player? I just want to say that I appreciate all the hard work you do for our household.": "",
    "Don't worry about me... I know you've got a lot of responsibilities outside of the house. I'm fine in here by myself!": "",
    "Oh, I'm not bored... I'm just enjoying what we have here.": "",
    "It's a simple life, but I like it.": "",
    "I hope you'll still like me when I'm old and gray.": "",
    "Do you think your grandpa would be proud of the work we've done?": "",
    "Taking a break? I guess being a farmer is easier than I thought...": "",
    "If you go into town, make sure and say hi to everyone for me.": "",
    "I'll do the laundry tomorrow morning before you get up... that way you won't have any down-time.": "",
    "Are we doing okay on money, @player?": "",
    "I wonder what everyone in town is doing today?": "",
    "I don't really feel like doing anything today.": "",
    "No matter how much I clean, the house keeps getting dirty again.": "",
    "I guess farms can be kind of dirty.": "",
    "I wonder if we'll live here our entire lives?": "",
    "...Do you still love me?": "",
    "*sigh*... Maybe we got married too young.": "",
    "Are you still happy with me?": "",
    "Did I do something wrong? You've been acting different lately.": "",
    "Do you ever wonder what else is out there?": "",
    "You used to be romantic... what happened?": "",
    "I know I'm not as young as I used to be... is that what you married me for?": "",
    "We only have one short life to live... is this the best way to do it?": "",
    "I used to be your sweetie... now you only seem to put up with me when I make a hot dinner.": "",
    "You've been so cold to me lately...": "",
    "I wonder if I could've done better.": "",
    "Well, a new year has arrived. Do you have a plan for what you want to accomplish this year?": "",
    "I feel pretty hopeful.": "",
    "Now that winter's over, we've got lots of productive weather to look forward to.": "",
    "I hope you've been practicing your moves... tomorrow is the flower dance!": "",
    "Make sure you don't get a heat stroke, dear.": "",
    "Drink plenty of water and don't overwork yourself.": "",
    "Sorry if I smell... I was sweating all night in the heat.": "",
    "It's summer... that means the house is full of flies.": "",
    "Don't worry, I'll take care of them.": "",
    "This weather feels pretty nice after the heat of summer.": "",
    "Winter's just around the corner. We need to double check the heating system, turn off the valves, and check all the insulation in the house.": "",
    "Don't worry, I'll take care of it all.": "",
    "Have you figured out what you're going to use for our grange display tomorrow?": "",
    "Should we go to the Spirit's Eve festival tomorrow night?": "",
    "Brrr.... It's cold. I guess winter has arrived.": "",
    "Are you going to enter the fishing contest tomorrow?": "",
    "Thanks for a great year, @player. I'm excited to tackle next year together.": "",
    "I'm feeling excited for a new year of farming, @player!": "",
    "I may like the colder seasons, but by the end I'm always glad to see spring arrive.": "",
    "Aren't you glad winter's over, honey? Things seem more hopeful now.": "",
    "Don't forget to look for wild horseradish, leeks and dandelions while you're out there!": "",
    "I'm so happy to see some greenery after that long white winter.": "",
    "Wow, my skin is pale... I guess I'd better help you with some farm work this season.": "",
    "Let's plant some healthy vegetables this spring.": "",
    "I'm looking forward to a beautiful year on @farm farm.": "",
    "Hey @player. Let's work hard today!": "",
    "*sniff* ... My doze is stubbed up... allergies.": "",
    "It's a good time of year to do some stargazing.": "",
    "Oh man... I could go for some chocolate cake.": "",
    "You must know by now that summer is my favorite season.": "",
    "Nothing pairs so well with summer like a nice sweet wine. Don't you think, honey?": "",
    "Are you growing any melons this summer?": "",
    "I'm going to stay inside as much as possible this summer.": "",
    "Make sure you don't get sunburnt, honey... That can really damage your skin.": "",
    "One of the main things I miss about the ocean is the fresh fish.": "",
    "I always have the most energy in the summer.": "",
    "Summer always makes me want to eat more barbecue.": "",
    "I'm glad I still work at the clinic... It's an important service for the community.": "",
    "I hope we're growing pumpkins this year.": "",
    "I'm craving cake.": "",
    "But not just any cake... it has to be pink.": "",
    "Breathe deep... can you smell that? That tells me it's mushroom season.": "",
    "It's so peaceful out here on the farm. I never appreciated nature that much living in town.": "",
    "My mother used to always make this delicious pumpkin soup in the fall.": "",
    "I could sure go for some wine.": "",
    "Ah... Fall. The warm sun drifts low in the sky, casting long shadows over waving fields of gold.": "",
    "It's a beautiful time of year, don't you think?": "",
    "I feel weak... I need some protein.": "",
    "I wonder what's going on in the rest of the world? We're really secluded here.": "",
    "Spring is coming soon. I'm really looking forward to having rhubarb pie.": "",
    "Remember when we played that 'Prairie King' game together, in my room? Those were good times.": "",
    "I was just thinking about the time you helped me open a jar of pickles.": "",
    "We've come a long way since then.": "",
    "I always start craving salad in the winter... Inconvenient, I know.": "",
    "I'm going to do a lot of reading this winter.": "",
    "I wonder what Sam's up to? We used to be really good friends.": "",
    "Winter is flu season, so work is probably going to be a lot more stressful. Sorry in advance if I'm grouchy.": "",
    "I think I might do some writing this winter. There's not much else to do, anyway.": "",
    "I hope my grandparents are doing okay. They used to rely on my help quite a bit. You know, with lifting heavy objects or whatever.": "",
    "I've given up on being a musician. I'm a family man now!": "",
    "I got up early to do a little star-gazing.": "",
    "I hope you don't mind if I spend some time on my projects today, honey.": "",
    "I got up a little before you and fed David Jr. He's very active this morning.": "",
    "I hope you don't mind the guinea pig smell.": "",
    "Go ahead and start your day, honey. I'm just putting on my make-up.": "",
    "Have any plans for the day?": "",
    "One of these days I'll have to do your portrait.": "",
    "The view from this window is inspiring, don't you think?": "",
    "I always wanted my very own library. This is so charming.": "",
    "I like to do a little reading first thing in the morning. It gets my brain into gear.": "",
    "I'm debating whether I should work or just read comics all day.": "",
    "Hey, do we have any pizza in the freezer? I'm hungry.": "",
    "No air-traffic this morning, honey. But it's still fun to break out the equipment now and then.": "",
    "I'm working on a new model plane. It's so much more relaxing here than in my old apartment.": "",
    "I think I might do some writing today.": "",
    "Will you be okay without my help?": "",
    "Don't ever let me get lazy. I want to stay in good shape for you!": "",
    "There's lots of room here to do my exercises. I'm making more progress than ever!": "",
    "The old guitar... I just don't have the drive to play it anymore. That's fine.": "",
