Juice takes the least amount of time to brew.^If wheat is placed in the keg, it will produce beer. Beer takes a while to brew, but it is quite profitable.^Placing hops in a keg will produced the beloved 'Pale Ale'^Place fruit in the keg to make wine. Wine takes the longest of all to make, but a wine made from the finest fruit is worth quite a bit!^Be patient with your keg... you'll know it's finished when it's perfectly still. And only drink in moderation, or you'll surely regret it!":"",
	"Mysteries Of The Dwarves^The Dwarves call themselves 'Smoluanu'... which translates to 'sky people'.

Evidence such as this had led me, despite the ridicule of my colleagues, to propose a new theory:^I believe the dwarves are the remnants of a once advanced civilization whose interplanetary vehicle crashed on this planet long ago.^I propose that this dwarvish spaceship bore down, deep underground... and over time, the dwarves became adapted to their new underground environment.^ My colleagues ask, 'Why didn't they come above ground and live on the surface?' ...Perhaps their old planet had a thicker atmosphere that protected them from stellar radiation, and they simply could not survive in our sunlight.^ That would explain why they only surface at night to take what they need from our houses...^^-M.

	"Farming involves growing crops and raising animals. Purchase seeds at Pierre's shop in town. Use your hoe to dig a 3x3 area on your farm      (Default key to use tools is 'c').":"",
	"Stand in the center of the tilled area and spread the seeds. Water them every day if it isn't raining, and eventually they will be ready for harvest.":"",
	"To raise animals you will need Robin to repair your coop or barn. Her shop can be found in the hills above town. When repairs are done, you can buy animals from Marnie's shop in the forest south of your farm.":"",
	"Make sure to buy some feed as well. Each animal requires one piece of animal food every day. Inside the coop and barn are feed dispensers and food troughs. For each animal, place one piece of food per day into the trough.":"",
	"Talk to your animals every day to improve their production skill. With a little planning and a bit of work, farming can be a reliable way of making a good income.":"",
