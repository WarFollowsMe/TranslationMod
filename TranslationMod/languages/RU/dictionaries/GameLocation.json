	"Tips On Farming--^*Use fertilizer to improve quality, reduce workload, or hasten crop growth.^*Fruit trees take a whole season to grow, but they require very little maintenance. Keep the area directly around your new sapling clear, or else it may not grow properly.^*Crops will die as soon as the season ends, unless they grow in multiple seasons (e.g. Corn).^*Some crops, such as kale and wheat, need to be harvested with the scythe.":"",

	"  How deep do the mines go?^ This question has been pondered by many Stardew Valley explorers over the years... The truth is, no one really knows. Or at least, they aren't telling anyone.^Unfortunately, many of those who venture deep into the mines never return...^However, there have been a few bold adventurers who have traveled deep into the mines, and have resurfaced with interesting reports.^ Apparently, there are three distinct areas in the mine, each with unique monsters and treasures.^Some adventurers speak of gigantic underground lakes and strange creatures... But none of these claims have been proven.":"",

	"'Scarecrows'^ Once you start growing a lot of crops on your farm, you can expect to be visited by crows. In the morning, you might discover that a crow has made breakfast out of your hard work!^One way to prevent those bothersome crows from eating your crops is to set up scarecrows near your crops.^Be aware that scarecrows have limited range, so you'll need multiple if your farm is large.^Scarecrows keep track of how many crows they've diverted. You can use that to tell if they're in a useful spot.^^* 'Collectible Scarecrows' aren't just for looks! They work just the same as the regular model.":"",

	"-- A Study On Diamond Yields --^^ After years of research in the mines, I believe I've learned something about diamond frequency.^My research involved only the stones that are scattered about the mines...The ones that are broken with a pickaxe. Mineral yields from other sources require more research.^Diamonds seem to only form at mine level 50 or greater. At level 50, approximately 1 in 500 stones will be diamond-rich.^ After level 50, the frequency of diamond formation seems to increase by about .000016 per level. Quite a rare gem!^-M. Jasper":"",
	"-~-Brewmaster's Guide-~-^   Ah... to brew! ^The rich smell of yeast wafting through a cedar loft... The floral overtones of freshly cut hops on a winter's eve... but I digress. You are probably more interested in the practical side of brewing...^To brew, you will need a keg. I'll leave it up to you to devise blueprints for a keg.^Kegs can be used to make several kinds of product. If vegetables are placed inside, the keg will produce juice. Juice takes the least amount of time to brew.^If wheat is placed in the keg, it will produce beer. Beer takes a while to brew, but it is quite profitable.^Placing hops in a keg will produced the beloved 'Pale Ale'^Place fruit in the keg to make wine. Wine takes the longest of all to make, but a wine made from the finest fruit is worth quite a bit!^Be patient with your keg... you'll know it's finished when it's perfectly still. And only drink in moderation, or you'll surely regret it!":"",
	"Mysteries Of The Dwarves^The Dwarves call themselves 'Smoluanu'... which translates to 'sky people'. An odd name for a group that lives deep underground, isn't it?^Another mystery of the dwarves is the advanced technology they supposedly possess. Evidence such as this had led me, despite the ridicule of my colleagues, to propose a new theory:^I believe the dwarves are the remnants of a once advanced civilization whose interplanetary vehicle crashed on this planet long ago.^I propose that this dwarvish spaceship bore down, deep underground... and over time, the dwarves became adapted to their new underground environment.^ My colleagues ask, 'Why didn't they come above ground and live on the surface?' ...Perhaps their old planet had a thicker atmosphere that protected them from stellar radiation, and they simply could not survive in our sunlight.^ That would explain why they only surface at night to take what they need from our houses...^^-M.

A vine sprung skyward, twisting and probing, casting a writhing shadow onto the golden void.^After 11 days, the vine bore fruit.^Yoba, with knowing wisdom, peeled the tough skin off the fruit and saw that the world was inside.^And so that is how the world came to be.":"",

Everyone knows what it means when you present them with one of those.^ It's rumored that on stormy days, the ghost of an old mariner appears in Stardew Valley, clutching just such a pendant.^ After the wedding ceremony, your partner will move in with you.

'The Legend'. He was a huge beast... And the harder I tugged on the line, the harder he tugged back. I let my guard down for a moment and he snapped my boat in two. I've never fished since.^Tex: Do you think anyone will ever catch him?^Gordy: Hmm... If this person were a master at fishing, and caught all other rare fish first, and made sure they ate the correct kind of food... then maybe.

Once you remove your gem the crystalarium will start working on yet another clone... You'll never need to restock it unless you want to change the kind of gem it produces!^Unfortunately, the crystalarium doesn't work with the extremely rare gemstone known as 'Prismatic Shard'... For some reason, the EMF from the shard interacts negatively with the crystalarium.":"",
	"Secrets Of The Legendary Fish^^Fishermen speak of five rare and unique fish that can only be caught by skilled anglers. Once caught, they will never appear again.^^The crimsonfish lives in the warm ocean waters of summer. It's been sighted on the far eastern side of the beach.^^The Glacierfish, which only appears in winter, can be caught off the southern tip of arrowhead island in Cindersap Forest... near where the river meets the ocean.^^The Anglerfish has been spotted in fall, north of town where the river flows down from the mountains.^^There's rumor of a strange, twisted fish that lives in the sewer.^^^^The final fish, of a species never before caught, is known simply as 'legend'. It is rumored that he lives in a log submerged in the mountain lake, and only ventures out on rainy spring days to nibble at the frog's eggs. Only the most skilled fisherman can hope to catch this one.^^Train at fishing and be persistent, and eventually you will catch these elusive fish. Make sure to respect the water and don't remove too many fish from the ecosystem.":"",

	"Stand in the center of the tilled area and spread the seeds. Water them every day if it isn't raining, and eventually they will be ready for harvest.":"",
	"To raise animals you will need Robin to repair your coop or barn. Her shop can be found in the hills above town. When repairs are done, you can buy animals from Marnie's shop in the forest south of your farm.":"",
	"Make sure to buy some feed as well. Each animal requires one piece of animal food every day. Inside the coop and barn are feed dispensers and food troughs. For each animal, place one piece of food per day into the trough.":"",
	"Talk to your animals every day to improve their production skill. With a little planning and a bit of work, farming can be a reliable way of making a good income.":"",
	"To fish, stand in front of the water and use your fishing rod. When something bites, use your rod again to claim your catch. Just make sure to be quick or whatever's biting might get away.":"",

	"In addition to ores, roots, and minerals, digging can unearth ancient artifacts of archaeological significance. Some artifacts can only be found in certain areas. Bring these to Gunther in town.":"",
	"Most of the buildings on your farm can be upgraded several times. These upgrades can be expensive, but in the long run they will allow you to earn more money.":"",
	"Upgrading your coop and barn will increase your animal capacity. Upgrading your house will increase its size as well as grant special perks. Your first house upgrade comes with a kitchen and crafting table.":"",
	"The second house upgrade will allow you to marry. The third will prove to the world that you are a great success! :}":"",
